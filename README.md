<br/>
Individual Assignment.

Provided are Java File, Form File and Textfile for this project. There is no folder directory provided. Form File are generated by Netbeans, not coded.

System name is adapted from a Genshin Impact in-game gadget called Serenitea Pot.

### üìå Assumptions made as below:
1. No same room ID may exist in text file as the filter function will only work for distinct Room ID.
2. Admin will know the correct input for each text fields and will not input the wrong format.
3. Admin will check the room availability for the room if the room was booked. For example, if a customer wants to book SR1 room, but it has been booked for a certain period, admin will need to check for the available day to book the room in history GUI.
4. Only resort admin will know the username and password of the system and it is totally secure.
5. Room ID, customer name, and check-in date are used together as a unique key to identify each customer data.
6. Only one admin can access the system.
